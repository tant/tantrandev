# Website Development Roadmap

This document outlines the strategic roadmap for the continued development of the personal branding website. The roadmap is based on the recommendations from the `CONSULTATION.md` and `FEATURE_CASE_STUDIES.md` documents.

The plan is broken down into three phases, designed to be executed in order to maximize impact.

---

## Phase 1: Content & Authority Building (Highest Priority)

**Goal:** To establish the website as a valuable resource that proves expertise and builds authority. This phase is critical for thought leadership and SEO.

### 1.1. Develop and Publish First Case Study
*   **Task:** Write the first detailed case study based on the plan in `docs/FEATURE_CASE_STUDIES.md`.
*   **Recommendation:** Choose the most compelling project that clearly demonstrates your problem-solving skills and business impact. A strong choice would be the "Founded & Scaled a Profitable Company" or "Led Hyper-Growth Team Expansion" highlight.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   Create the necessary page structure: `/case-studies` and `/case-studies/[slug]`.
    *   Add "Case Studies" to the main navigation.
    *   Add a CTA on the homepage to the new section.

### 1.2. Develop and Publish First Playbook
*   **Task:** Write the first in-depth playbook.
*   **Recommendation:** Choose a topic you are passionate about and that provides significant value to your target audience (e.g., "The Manager's Playbook for Scaling a Tech Team").
*   **Implementation:**
    *   Create a dedicated page for the playbook under the `/playbooks` section.
    *   Ensure the content is well-structured, practical, and easy to read.

## Phase 2: Enhancing Credibility & Personal Connection

**Goal:** To add powerful social proof and a human element to the website, building deeper trust and rapport with the audience.

### 2.1. Implement a "Testimonials" Section
*   **Task:** Gather 2-3 strong testimonials and add them to the website.
*   **Recommendation:** Reach out to former managers, clients, or senior colleagues who can speak to your leadership and impact.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   Design and build a dedicated "Testimonials" section, likely on the homepage.

### 2.2. Add a Personal Introductory Video
*   **Task:** Record and embed a short (60-90 second) introductory video.
*   **Recommendation:** The video should be authentic and briefly introduce your philosophy.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   Add the video to a prominent location, such as the "About" page.

## Phase 3: Long-Term Growth & Promotion

**Goal:** To expand the website's reach, attract a wider audience, and continuously reinforce the personal brand.

### 3.1. Expand Content Library
*   **Task:** Add a second and third case study and playbook.
*   **Recommendation:** Choose projects and topics that showcase different skills and areas of expertise to create a well-rounded profile.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   Add new pages for the new content, following the established structure.

### 3.2. Develop a Content & Promotion Strategy
*   **Task:** Create a simple calendar for future content and a plan for promoting it.
*   **Recommendation:**
    *   Brainstorm a list of future topics.
    *   Plan to share new content (case studies, playbooks) on professional networks like LinkedIn.
    *   Engage with your audience and participate in relevant discussions.

By following this phased approach, we can systematically enhance the website, turning it from a professional profile into a powerful engine for personal brand growth and opportunity generation.
